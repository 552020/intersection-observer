Messing around with the [intersection observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)

1. sticky navigation bar popping up when the first section comes into view: check.
2. sections fade-in: check.
3. sections fade out: to do.
4. a slider - without 'dots' and with only images for the section1: check.
